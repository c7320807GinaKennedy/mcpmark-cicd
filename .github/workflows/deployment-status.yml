# Deployment Status Workflow

This GitHub Actions workflow implements a comprehensive deployment tracking system for the Node.js project. It triggers on push events to the main branch and executes three sequential jobs:

1. pre-deployment - Performs quality checks and creates a deployment tracking issue
2. rollback-preparation - Creates comprehensive rollback artifacts and documentation
3. post-deployment - Updates the deployment status and closes the tracking issue

The workflow ensures that every deployment has a verified rollback plan in place before completion.
